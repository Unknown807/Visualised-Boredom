# Visualised-Boredom

Have a go via <a href="https://unknown807.github.io/Visualised-Boredom/">GitHub pages</a> (In my experience it looks good on Firefox)

## Description

A program that allows you to interactively use the <a href="https://www.boredapi.com/">BoredAPI</a> and get back responses in a graphical way.

Edit: I should've used svg for the graphics, but the ms paint was just too tempting

## How To Use

<div align="center">

The query options will be at the top and they let you choose what type of activity you want to do, what the cost and accessibility of the activity should be and how many people you want to participate (doesn't return any activites greater than 5).

You can also specify a price and accessibility range if you want to get results back according to said range.

If you don't want to include certain parameters, then if you click on the parameter labels they will be omitted from the query. Additionally, by selecting the dropdown to get the price and accessibility ranges, it will omit the above specific price or accessibility.

To use the parameters when sending the query, press the 'Find Something To Do' label beneath the options. To skip having to omit the options, to get a truly random activity, press the large text in the middle of the page that displays the activities.
